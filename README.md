# CAPSTONE-PROJECT
Statement: CT Scan Image Classification
Prediction: If a person is infected by SARS-CoV-2 through the analysis of his/her CT scans.
INPUT: This dataset contains CT scans that are positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) and non-infected by SARS-CoV-2.
TOTAL IMage :2482 CT scans 


The aim of this project is to research and development of artificial intelligent methods which are able to identify 
if a person is infected by SARS-CoV-2 through the analysis of his/her CT scans.Based on the detailed understanding,processing and modeling over the provided set of CT scan dataset. 

STEPS APPLIED:

1-Data Collection- This dataset contains 1252 CT scans that are positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection (COVID-19) and 1230 CT scans 
for patients non-infected by SARS-CoV-2, 2482 CT scans in total. These data have been collected from real patients in hospitals 
from Sao Paulo, Brazil.

2-Data Augmentation- I did Data Augmentation to increase the size of my test and train data so my model can predict more accurately

3-Model Training: I have used CNN with layer model like - ResNet-50.

4. Final Prediction and Accuracy evaluation.
